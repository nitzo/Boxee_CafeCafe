Boxee Job Manager
An easily extensible threaded job manager that works in Boxee.
Written by /rob, 9 March 2011

Usage:
A common requirement of Boxee apps is to run some code at an interval without blocking the thread in which Boxee apps execute most of
their code. To address this increasingly common requirement, I put together this interface to create your own arbitrarily defined jobs
and had them off to a "Job Manager" that runs in its own thread, letting your GUI onclick events and the like run without waiting for it
to return.

The most commonly needed job is for a webservice to be called every n seconds while video plays. To use the JobManager in this instance,
simply create your job by extending the BoxeeJob class, instantiate the JobManager, add your custom Job to the manager, and start it
before executing mc.GetPlayer().Play().

Examples:

Instantiate object:
myJobManager = BoxeeJobManager()

Process job queue every 30 seconds (instead of default 10):
myJobManager = BoxeeJobManager(30)

Add job to Job Manager:

myJob = BoxeeJob()
myJobManager.addJob(myJob)

Start Job Manager:
myJobManager.start()

Stop Job Manager:
myJobManager.stop()

Extending the Job Object:
The job object is your primary interface for creating and executing Jobs with the Job Manager. Here is an easy hello world example where
the string "Hello, world!" is printed to your Boxee debug log every ten seconds.

import mc
import jobmanager
class HelloWorldJob(jobmanager.BoxeeJob):
# Add your own variables to constructor.
def __init__(self, message, interval):
self.message = message
self.interval = interval
# Be sure to always inherit the constructor from the base BoxeeJob class.
jobmanager.BoxeeJob.__init__(self, "HelloWorld", interval)
def process(self):
# This is the base function that is always called for every job and the one you should extend.
mc.LogDebug(self.message)
